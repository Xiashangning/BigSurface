# BigSurface
The name comes from macOS Big Sur.
Big Sur + Surface -> Big Surface (LOL)

PS : If you have a better name, please let me know.

**A proposition for a fully intergrated kext for all Surface Pro related hardwares**

## How to install

You will need to add the kext into opencore's `config.plist` in the order specified as below

## TODO
- Surface Type Cover                            **Done**
  
  > The code is based on VoodooI2CHID.kext, but added **integrated and hot pluggable touchpad&keyboard support**.
  > For macOS Monterey multitouch and gesture support, you need to modify info.plist in BigSurface.kext. Under Root > IOKitPersonalities > Surface Type Cover Driver, change IOProbeScore from 300 to 9300. **This will break multitouch support in Big Sur, so if you wish to dual boot these two, make sure to have MinKernel set to 21.00.0.** The rest of the kexts integrated into BigSurface remain the same, so no changes are needed. You can make two copies of just the BigSurface kext (one without integrated kexts) and have one with this fix and MinKernel (be sure to set MaxKernel to **20.99.9** in your Big Sur one so that there are duplicate loading issues).
- Battery status--Surface Serial Hub            **Most Important**
  > See https://github.com/linux-surface/surface-aggregator-module.
  > To obtain the battery readout, one needs to register the operation handler for _SAN device(called via _SAN.RQST) and send the request to SSH device.
  > SSH is a UART controller, **the low level uart operation(tx, rx)** is needed to be completed. Thus an expert in UART development is needed.
  > Other than that, the rest of the code is not hard to port, mainly how to encode and decode the request packages. 
  >
  > The Surface Laptop and Surface Book things can be deleted.
- Performance mode
  
  > Depends on Surface Serial Hub driver
- Buttons
  
  > WIP
- Ambient Light Sensor
  > ACPI device name: ACSD, attached under I2C4
  > The Linux source code is attached in the folder, just one source file, should be 'easy' to port.(Maybe we don't need gesture and proximity)
  > Driver should attach to VoodooI2CDeviceNub and use it to perform I2C IO.
  > See VoodooI2CSynaptics for code reference.
- Cameras
  > ACPI devices: CAMR,CAMF,CAM3(infrared camera)
  > Corresponding device id: OV8865,OV5693,OV7251
  > Not so important, they use I2C to transfert data. Linux code available.
- Touch Screen
  > Device id: 0x34E4
  > Linux uses `mei` to communicate with the touch screen(ipts), don't know the equivalant thing on macOS nor how to communicate with it.
